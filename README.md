Capstone project
Motorsport Marshalling Services is a not-for-profit organization of volunteers which staffs major and amateur motorsport events with safety personnel (workers/applicants) at Canadian Tire Motorsport Park. On non-race day events the track is rented out to organizers who bring in groups of people for high speed driver training. For those events, workers apply to work the event and await selection confirmation from the MMS rep who organizes the worker compliment for those private events. Not everyone who applies is selected, but all who apply receive a templated email indicating their selection one way or another. 

We are looking for a tool to assist Robb Dobbie, track day coordinator, in recording, managing and communicating all the necessary details of a track day. A key factor will be ensuring it is scalable to possible include the initial registration process. Robb currently uses a programmed Excel file that is no longer able to accommodate the large number of events in a year. The file itself is password protected, and thus we are unable to adjust the VB Script within. Beyond that there are features this file is unable to serve which Robb would like to see in an updated version of the file as a standalone application.
